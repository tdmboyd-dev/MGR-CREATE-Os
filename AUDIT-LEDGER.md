# Legacy Verification Ledger

Legacy code copied from MGR Agents is evidence only.

## Current known facts
- `legacy/mgr-agents/src/lib/db/schema/creation-os.ts` exists and defines graph, continuity violations, crew rooms, CINEFORGE pipeline state, pipeline runs, and UCT provenance.
- `legacy/mgr-agents/src/lib/db/schema/approvals.ts` defines approval/risk structures and Creation OS action names.
- `legacy/mgr-agents/src/lib/db/schema/brand-face.ts` defines identity/brand asset state.
- `legacy/mgr-agents/src/lib/db/schema/training.ts` defines training queues/jobs/runs/adapters/swarm registry.
- `legacy/mgr-agents/src/lib/db/schema/hybrid.ts` defines a hybrid descriptor/universal grammar primitive.

## Not yet proven
None of the above is considered independently functional merely because schema code exists.

Each capability must be traced through:
schema → migration → service/domain logic → route/event/worker → UI/client if applicable → test → real execution → observed output/evidence.

## Verification categories
UNKNOWN | SCHEMA_ONLY | PARTIAL | EXECUTES_UNVERIFIED | TESTED | VERIFIED

Initial state for all imported legacy capabilities: UNKNOWN until audited.

## 2026-09-29 functional research / stale status repair
Replaced current-tense 58-only scope in docs/BEAST-WAVE-STATUS.md with dated historical scope and links to the 74-track expansion and 40-path child decomposition. Preserved old implementation history. Corrected pending-packet wording in WORK-STATE.md. Primary-source versus existing-code comparison reproduced three iKickItz defects; no foreign product source copied here and no iKickItz repair claimed. Dossier and machine-readable evidence record exact scope.
